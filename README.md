# Train_Scheduler

Summary
This is an application whose basic function is track multiple train schedules that the user creates. 

Usage
- A few stock train schedules are already loaded in the database as examples for the user to base their new trains off. 
- At the top is the application's title. 
- In the middle section, we have a running display of train schedules. This display is automatically updated when any changes (new train objects) are detected in the database. 
- In the bottom section, we have a form where the user can create a new train by inputting some very basic and straight forward data about any train ticket they purchase. 
- In the background, the application handles calculations for the arrival of the next train and how many minutes until that next train arrives. 

Importance
- This application provides a way to characters in the Looney Tunes world who are constantly traveling to see what trains they have coming up. 
- They are able to create a new train trip with an easy to use UI and not have to deal with any calculations on their own. 

Get Started
- To get started, simply scroll to forom at the bottom of the application. 
- Refer to your recently purchased train ticket and use the information on their to fill out the form. 
- After you have filled out all the fields, click the submit button and see that your train trip will appear above in the display. 
- Safe travels :)
